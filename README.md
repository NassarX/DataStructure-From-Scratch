# Data Structure From Scratch

### ****Covered Data Structures :****

- [Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/):  **Array** is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored sequentially in memory.
    1. **Array** **Types**
        - One-dimensional
        - Multi-dimensional
    2. ****Basic Operations****
        - Insert — Inserts an element at a given index
        - Get — Returns the element at a given index
        - Delete — Deletes an element at a given index
        - Size — Gets the total number of elements in an array
    3. ****Commonly asked Array interview questions****
        - Find the second minimum element of an array
        - First non-repeating integers in an array
        - Merge two sorted arrays
        - Rearrange positive and negative values in an array
        

- [Stacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/): **Stacks** are linear data structures in a LIFO (last-in, first-out) order.
    1. **Basic Operations**
        - Push — Inserts an element at the top
        - Pop — Returns the top element after removing from the stack
        - isEmpty — Returns true if the stack is empty
        - Top — Returns the top element without removing from the stack
    2. ****Commonly asked Array interview questions****
        - Evaluate postfix expression using a stack
        - Sort values in a stack
        - Check balanced parentheses in an expression
    

- [Queues](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/): **Queue** is another linear data structure that stores the element in a sequential manner. The only significant difference between Stack and Queue is that instead of using the LIFO method, Queue implements the FIFO **method, which is short for First in First Out.
    1. ****Basic operations****
        - Enqueue() — Inserts an element to the end of the queue
        - Dequeue() — Removes an element from the start of the queue
        - isEmpty() — Returns true if the queue is empty
        - Top() — Returns the first element of the queue
    2. ****Commonly asked Queue interview questions****
        - Implement stack using a queue
        - Reverse first k elements of a queue
        - Generate binary numbers from 1 to n using a queue

- [Linked Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/): A **linked list** is a linear sequence of nodes that are linked together. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
    1. **LinkedList Types**
        - Singly Linked List (Unidirectional)
        - Doubly Linked List (Bi-directional)
    2. ***Basic operations***
        - *InsertAtEnd* — Inserts a given element at the end of the linked list
        - *InsertAtHead* — Inserts a given element at the start/head of the linked list
        - *Delete* — Deletes a given element from the linked list
        - *DeleteAtHead* — Deletes the first element of the linked list
        - *Search* — Returns the given element from a linked list
        - *isEmpty* — Returns true if the linked list is empty
    3. ****Commonly asked Linked List interview questions****
        - Reverse a linked list
        - Detect loop in a linked list
        - Return Nth node from the end in a linked list
        - Remove duplicates from a linked list

- [Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/): A **binary search tree** is a binary tree data structure made up of nodes
    1. **Trees Types**
        - N-ary Tree
        - Balanced Tree
        - **Binary Tree**
        - **Binary Search Tree**
        - AVL Tree
        - Red Black Tree
        - 2–3 Tree
    2. ****Commonly asked Tree interview questions****
        - Find the height of a binary tree
        - Find kth maximum value in a binary search tree
        - Find nodes at “k” distance from the root
        - Find ancestors of a given node in a binary tree

- [Hash Tables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/): A **hash table** is implemented by storing elements in an array and identifying them through a key. So, the object is stored in the form of a “key-value” pair, and the collection of such items is called a “dictionary.” Each object can be searched using that key.
    1. **The performance of hashing depends upon :**
        - Hash Function
        - Size of the Hash Table
        - Collision Handling Method
    2. **Commonly asked Hashing interview questions**
        - Find symmetric pairs in an array
        - Trace complete path of a journey
        - Find if an array is a subset of another array
        - Check if given arrays are disjoint
        

- [Graphs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/): A **graph** is a set of nodes that are connected to each other in the form of a network.
    1. **Graph Types**
        - Undirected Graph
        - Directed Graph
    2. **Graphs can be represented using two forms:**
        - Adjacency Matrix
        - Adjacency List
    3. **Graph traversing algorithms**
        - Breadth First Search
        - Depth First Search
    4. ****Commonly asked Graph interview questions****
        - Implement Breadth and Depth First Search
        - Check if a graph is a tree or not
        - Count the number of edges in a graph
        - Find the shortest path between two vertices
        

- [Tries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/) It’s a tree-like data structure which proves to be quite efficient for solving problems related to strings. It provides fast retrieval, and is **mostly used for searching words in a dictionary,** providing auto suggestions in a search engine, and even for IP routing.
    1. **Commonly asked Trie interview questions:**
        - Count total number of words in Trie
        - Print all words stored in Trie
        - Sort elements of an array using Trie
        - Form words from a dictionary using Trie
        - Build a T9 dictionary
